# User Tests

User tests have been made at different stages:
* During the 'UX: Usability Testing' lessions
* At the site were the tool shall be used (Swisscom)
* At Marco's company site

## Here are the findings mentioned at >1 site:
* Sorting on multiple columns is a nice feature. Nevertheless current implementation needs some kind of usage.
  Furthermore future will show how much this will be used.
* The mobile view takes a lot of space. Most people prefer the table view.


## Findings from Marco's company:
* ???


## Swisscom's site
PortMatrix is thought to be used within different Swisscom departments.
Findings at the user's site:
* Since the requirements phase was very short some more investigations need be done. (There are several
reasons this has not been done earlier: Data model may grow heavily but we are attending a front end cours!)
* What needs to be shown on the browsing view is a point of discussion.
* The use of systems and environments need more discussions.
* The use of colors and other markup need more investigation.
